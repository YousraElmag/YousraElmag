# 💫 About Me:
Hello! I’m Yousra, a passionate developer from Egypt.  

My journey into the tech world began after completing my degree in Archaeology at Cairo University. Along the way, I’ve lived in several countries, explored diverse cultures, and mastered a variety of hobbies, each shaping my unique perspective.  

My latest passion is programming. I started as a self-taught developer and later honed my skills through HackYourFuture academy, where I gained professional expertise. Since then, I’ve worked on a number of impactful projects that reflect my dedication to learning and growth.
